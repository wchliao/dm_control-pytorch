# Use PyTorch To Play DeepMind Control Suite

Reinforcement learning models implemented in PyTorch for [DeepMind Control Suite](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.00690.pdf).

Currently only DQN is implemented, which is modified from [PyTorch Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html).
